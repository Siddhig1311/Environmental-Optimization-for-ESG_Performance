# Environmental-Optimization-for-ESG_Performance
**Repository Description:**   "A data-driven project focused on optimizing environmental metrics to enhance ESG scores. This repository includes advanced analytics techniques like correlation analysis, time-series forecasting, and scenario modeling to provide actionable insights for improving sustainability performance."

## Project Overview

The project, "Optimizing Environmental Metrics: A Data-Driven Approach," aims to identify and analyze the leading factors influencing carbon emissions in Siemens' operations. By assessing factors such as renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency measures, and supply chain decarbonization, the project will explore their impact on the environmental component of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores. Additionally, data-driven models will be developed to forecast future environmental performance and pinpoint potential areas for improvement.

## Objectives

- **Identify Leading Factors**: Analyze the key factors influencing carbon emissions in Siemens' operations and compare their relative importance.
- **Impact on ESG Scores**: Investigate how changes in leading factors, such as renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency measures, will influence Siemens' ESG scores.
- **Data-Informed Models**: Develop models to forecast Siemens' future environmental performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Files**: Raw data files related to Siemens' operations, including carbon emissions, energy usage, and ESG score information.
- **Analysis**: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that analyze the data, perform calculations, and generate insights.
- **Modeling**: Code for developing forecasting models based on historical environmental performance.
- **Results**: Visualizations and reports showing findings, including key insights on environmental factors and ESG performance.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/optimizing-environmental-metrics.git

2. Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Place the data files in the `data/` folder.

4. Run the analysis scripts or Jupyter notebooks to begin your analysis.

## Usage

- **Data Analysis**: Scripts for cleaning and analyzing Siemens' operational data to identify key factors affecting carbon emissions.
- **Modeling**: Use the forecasting models to predict future environmental performance.
- **ESG Score Analysis**: Explore the relationship between environmental factors and ESG scores to understand potential improvements.
